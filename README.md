### Hey, I am Nijat ðŸ‘‹

I am a Flutter Developer in Baku, Azerbaijan.

I have 1-1.5+ years in deep expertise in Flutter/Dart development. During this time I have developed apps for both freelances and  in the company (Mainly for Startups). I have developed apps like as e-commerce, social media, delivery apps etc. I discovered what Flutter can do and now I know Flutter's power.
